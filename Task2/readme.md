# Task 2: Landmark Detection on a 3D Facial Point Cloud

## Objective
Detect the **tip of the nose** from a 3D facial point cloud.

---

## Approach

1. **Landmark Detection**
   - Center the point cloud.
   - Identify the nose tip as the point with **maximum Z-coordinate** (most protruding).

2. **Visualization**
   - Overlay a red sphere at the detected nose tip for verification.


## Visualization

A red sphere is overlaid at the detected nose tip for visual verification.

This helps ensure the correctness of the landmark detection.

**Figure:** Red sphere indicating detected nose tip.

## Challenges Encountered

### Pretrained Models
- Attempted to use pretrained landmark detection models.
- These produced inaccurate results in 3D space.

### Curvature-Based Heuristic
- Tried identifying the nose tip as the point of maximum curvature.
- This often misidentified points around the neck region due to local shape variations.
